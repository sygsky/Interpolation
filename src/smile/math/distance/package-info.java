/**
 * Distance and metric measures. A distance function maps pairs of
 * points into the nonnegative reals and has to satisfy
 * <ul>
 * <li> non-negativity: d(x, y) &ge; 0
 * <li> isolation: d(x, y) = 0 if and only if x = y
 * <li> symmetry: d(x, y) = d(x, y)
 * </ul>.
 * Note that a distance function is not required to satisfy triangular
 * inequality |x - y| + |y - z| &ge; |x - z|, which is necessary for a metric.
