/**
 * A Mercer Kernel is a kernel that is positive semi-definite. When a kernel
 * is positive semi-definite, one may exploit the kernel trick, the idea of
 * implicitly mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space where some
 * linear algorithm is applied that works exclusively with inner products.
 * Assume we have some mapping &#934; from an input space X to a feature space H,
 * then a kernel k(u, v) = &lt;&#934;(u), &#934;(v)&gt; may be used to define the
 * inner product in feature space H.
 * <p>
 * Positive definiteness in the context of kernel functions also implies that
 * a kernel matrix created using a particular kernel is positive semi-definite.
 * A matrix is positive semi-definite if its associated eigenvalues are nonnegative.
