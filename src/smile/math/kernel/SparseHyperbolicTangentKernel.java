/**
 * The hyperbolic tangent kernel.
 * k(u, v) = tanh(&gamma; u<sup>T</sup>v - &lambda;), where &gamma; is the scale
 * of the used inner product and &lambda; is the offset of the used inner
 * product. If the offset is negative the likelihood of obtaining a kernel
 * matrix that is not positive definite is much higher (since then even some
 * diagonal elements may be negative), hence if this kernel has to be used,
 * the offset should always be positive. Note, however, that this is no
 * guarantee that the kernel will be positive.
 * <p>
 * The hyperbolic tangent kernel was quite popular for support vector machines
 * due to its origin from neural networks. However, it should be used carefully
 * since the kernel matrix may not be positive semi-definite. Besides, it was
 * reported the hyperbolic tangent kernel is not better than the Gaussian kernel
 * in general..
