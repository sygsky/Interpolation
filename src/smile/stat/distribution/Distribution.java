 * Probability distribution of univariate random variable. A probability

 * the probability of the value falling within a particular interval (when

 * set of real numbers, the probability distribution is completely described
 * by the cumulative distribution function, whose value at each real x is the
 * probability that the random variable is smaller than or equal to x.
