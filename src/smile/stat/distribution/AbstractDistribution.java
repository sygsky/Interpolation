     * Use the rejection technique to draw a sample from the given distribution.
     * WARNING : this simulation technique can take a very long time.
     * Rejection sampling is also commonly called the acceptance-rejection
     * method or "accept-reject algorithm".
     * It generates sampling values from an arbitrary probability distribution
     * function f(x) by using an instrumental distribution g(x), under the
     * only restriction that f(x) < M g(x) where M > 1 is an appropriate
     * bound on f(x) / g(x).
     * <p>
     * Rejection sampling is usually used in cases where the form of f(x)
     * makes sampling difficult. Instead of sampling directly from the
     * distribution f(x), we use an envelope distribution M g(x) where
     * sampling is easier. These samples from M g(x) are probabilistically
     * accepted or rejected.
     * <p>
     * This method relates to the general field of Monte Carlo techniques,
     * including Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that also use a proxy
     * distribution to achieve simulation from the target distribution f(x).
     * It forms the basis for algorithms such as the Metropolis algorithm.

     * sampling method can be improved on, given substantial research
     * effort, e.g. the ziggurat algorithm and rejection sampling.
