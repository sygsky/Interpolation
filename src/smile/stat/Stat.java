     * Bayesian information criterion (BIC). BIC or Schwarz Criterion is a criterion for
     * model selection among a class of parametric models with different numbers
     * of parameters. Choosing a model to optimize BIC is a form of regularization.
     * <p>
     * When estimating model parameters using maximum likelihood estimation, it
     * is possible to increase the likelihood by adding additional parameters,
     * which may result in over-fitting. The BIC resolves this problem by
     * introducing a penalty term for the number of parameters in the model.
     * BIC is very closely related to the Akaike information criterion (AIC).
     * However, its penalty for additional parameters is stronger than that of AIC.
     * <p>
     * The formula for the BIC is BIC = L - 0.5 * v * log n where L is the
     * log-likelihood of estimated model, v is the number of free parameters
     * to be estimated in the model, and n is the number of samples.
     * <p>
     * Given any two estimated models, the model with the larger value of BIC is
     * the one to be preferred.
     *
     * @param L the log-likelihood of estimated model.
     * @param v the number of free parameters to be estimated in the model.
     * @param n the number of samples.
     * @return BIC score.

     * Goodâ€“Turing frequency estimation. This technique is for estimating the
     * probability of encountering an object of a hitherto unseen species,
     * given a set of past observations of objects from different species.
     * In drawing balls from an urn, the 'objects' would be balls and the
     * 'species' would be the distinct colors of the balls (finite but
     * unknown in number). After drawing R_red red balls, R_black black
     * balls and , R_green green balls, we would ask what is the probability
     * of drawing a red ball, a black ball, a green ball or one of a
     * previously unseen color.
     *
     * This method takes a set of (frequency, frequency-of-frequency) pairs and
     * estimate the probabilities corresponding to the observed frequencies,
     * and P<sub>0</sub>, the joint probability of all unobserved species.

     * @param r the frequency in ascending order.
